# ðŸ“Š Project: Simple API 1

### Goal: Display data returned from an api

I completed the challenge: 4

I feel good about my code: 2

Will have to add more. Was following a tuorial that used fetch text instead of JSON. Changed to JSON to add more and came about alot of issues. WIll revisit and redo.
